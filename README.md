# ERSCORD

This is not a real project. I was just bored and i wanted to redo the discord interface in less than a day. Here's the result.
I did not create a server to run it. If you want, you can run a python server with the following command, when in the main folder.

```python3 -m http.server```

## Change sender :

- Enter : Ersen
- AltGr : Speed
- Escape : ZOmegaZZ

Enjoy :)
